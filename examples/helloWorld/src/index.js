 * TODO: This "Hello World" program implements a KraGL application that does

 * the Hello World of any OpenGL system, really.
 *
 * Do also notice that this application uses the ES-Next module system.
 * Grunt takes care of all the work of putting together the app.cat.js file
 * for the whole application from the src code.
