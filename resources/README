This resources directory contains various resources such as images and sound used in KraGL's unit tests and examples.

I created some of these resources myself. Others I pulled from various sources on the web. As such, none of these resources are covered by KraGL's license, nor are they actually part of the KraGL distribution. They are all purely for demonstrational or testing purposes.
